# Programming Languages (CS305) Homework Assignments

Here are my Programming Languages (CS305) homework assignments. <br>

- In the first assignment, implemented a scanner (lexical analyzer) using Flex. <br>
- In the second assignment, implemented a parser (syntax analyzer) using Bison, and created a context-free grammar. <br>
- Building upon the foundations laid in the first two assignments, the third assignment extended the basic formalism of CFG. This involved associating attributes with grammar symbols and establishing rules for computing or evaluating these attributes during the parsing process. Throughout these three assignments, I developed an attributed grammar for a MailScript program. <br>
- The fourth and fifth assignments focused on implementing Scheme interpreter. <br>

Please keep in mind that the 3rd and 5th assignments have some missing parts, while the others received perfect scores.
